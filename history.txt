The greatest supporter of militant Catholicism in the second half of the 1500s was King Philip II.
He was the son of Charles Vâ€”the Holy Roman Emperor, King of Spain, and Archduke of Austria. 
Charles V's brother, Ferdinand I, succeeded him as Holy Roman Emperor. 
Philip II inherited the kingdoms of Milan, Naples, Sicily, the Netherlands, and Spain and its empire in the Americas from Charles V. Philip, who reigned from 1556 to 1598, ushered in an age of Spanish greatness. 
To strengthen his control, Philip insisted on strict conformity to Catholicism and strong monarchial authority. He also had the powerful Spanish navy at his command. 
Around 1500, Catholic kingdoms in Spain had reconquered Muslim areas there and expelled Spanish Jews. 
Muslims were forced to convert or go into exile. 
Spain saw itself as a nation chosen by God to save Catholic Christianity from Protestant heretics. Philip II, the Most Catholic King, championed Catholic causes. 
His actions led to spectacular victories and defeats. Spain's leadership of a Holy League against the Turks resulted in a stunning victory over the Turkish fleet in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. 
Philip was not so fortunate in his other conflicts.
